# Creating/editing pages {#addPage}

Before we can make a wiki, we have to know how to do basic edits to a page. You'd be surprised at how many things require special attention to modify on the wiki.

## Wiki pages structure {#structure}

The iGEM wiki is structured in a very straightforward manner.

`http://[YEAR].igem.org/Team:[TEAM]` will lead you to the main page. Take note that there is **no backslash** after this. If you have a backslash, then you will go to a blank uncreated page.

There are many special pages that the judges take into consideration for determining what medal you will receive at the Jamboree. These pages can be found [here](http://2017.igem.org/Judging/Pages_for_Awards). For example, the `Attributions` page for your team will follow the structure `http://[YEAR].igem.org/Team:[TEAM]/Attributions`.

Additionally, the human practices pages are a bit funky, but they follow the same structure, they just have a `/HP/` before them. You *shouldn't* think about this as if it was a file pathway, but rather a page with the page title `/HP/Gold_Integrated` or so.
